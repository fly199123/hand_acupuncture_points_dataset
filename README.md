# Hand_acupuncture_points_dataset

The dataset preparation process was divided into three stages. First, volunteers from different age groups were recruited to collect hand videos, from which frame-by-frame sampling and image screening were performed to obtain 1,717 original hand images. To improve the model’s generalization and robustness, brightness, color, and contrast augmentation were applied to the original images, yielding a total of 8,585 images. Next, professional physicians were invited to annotate the acupoints using the COCO annotation format. Specifically, three acupoints — Zhongzhu (TE3), Hegu (LI4), and Yangxi (LI5) — were labeled on the dorsum of the hand, while two acupoints — Yuji (LU10) and Shenmen (HT7) — were labeled on the palmar side. It should be noted that each acupoint was independently annotated by three senior physicians with more than five years of clinical experience. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion until a consensus was reached. This process minimized subjective bias and reduced random annotation errors to the greatest extent possible. Finally, following the dataset split strategy described in prior work, the dataset was split into training and test sets at a 7:3 ratio.
